# Contributing to **nanoFramework**

## Financial contributions

People contributing to **nanoFramework** do so in the spirit of Open Source, our community, developers using **nanoFramework** and, most importantly, pushing the embedded systems world forward together in a community effort.

We've setup an Open Collective to manage our funding in a completely transparent way. Yes, funding is required. There are infrastructure costs; PR efforts to make the project known in the embedded systems industry, throughout hobbyist communities and academia; marketing work; development and maintenance tasks that no one volunteers to do; supporting projects that we depend on...

## How can I help?

Almost everyone can help the project in a number of ways:

- Ask your employer to use **nanoFramework** in projects.
- If you are a teacher or work in training, use **nanoFramework** in your courses, classes and workshops.
- If you are a maker publish your projects on platforms such as [Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/nanoframework), spread the word by tweeting about us, mentioning us on the forums and communities where you are engaged in.
- Contribute to the various repositories. From the [nf-interpreter](https://github.com/nanoframework/nf-interpreter) from where the images running on the targets devices come to the various class libraries, Visual Studio extension and various utilities.
- Using **nanoFramework** in your projects and report back bugs that you find and/or suggest better ways to accomplish something or even new features that can improve the framework.
- Help writing and maintaining the documentation for the various components, getting started guides, tutorials, target devices.
- Hangout on our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/gCyBu8T) answering developers questions, providing guidance and mentorship, welcoming people.
- Help managing, triaging and answering to GitHub issues.
- Contribute with web design and creative design for the project website and other graphic and visual needs.
- Become a backer or supporter through our [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/nanoframework).

## Encouraging employers

You can ask your employer to improve your (and the company) productivity  by using **nanoFramework** in projects. Explain to them how **nanoFramework** can help developing an embedded system project, no matter if it's a proof of concept for a potential customer or if it's a complex IoT device. How easy is to use the tools available for a smooth debugging experience.

## Executives

CTO's, VPs and business owners can also help **nanoFramework**!
**nanoFramework** along with C# and Visual Studio can give your team a tremendous productivity boost. Imagine slashing down the number of hours required to complete a project and making it's maintenance easier.
If you're not willing to take our word for it, perhaps you will if it comes from a reputable source in the industry like Altium. Checkout this [article](https://resources.altium.com/pcb-design-blog/high-level-programming-languages-for-embedded-projects) from their blog, where industry expert Mark Harris goes through a deep analysis on the benefits of using high level programming languages like C# and **nanoFramework** for embedded projects. It includes some interesting numbers on costs, budgets and estimates.

## Sponsorship

Besides monetary contribution, companies can support **nanoFramework** by providing developers time. This can come from developers that are between projects or tasks and are not actively working on a company project in certain period. Or maybe there is a project already using **nanoFramework** for which a specific feature is not available yet or requires improvements. Developers working on it can use their time to code that and contribute back to the project.

## Developers

The project needs people with skills on C/C++ and C#. No need to be a subject matter expert! Even the smallest contribution matters.

We welcome embedded system developers familiar with platforms we target: ESP32, STM32, TI CC32xx and NXP. Also that are familiar with the RTOSes used: FreeRTOS, ChibiOS and TI SimpleLink.

C# developers with general coding experiencing, coding Visual Studio extension development, coding with Visual Studio debugging components, willing to write unit tests.
