<h1 id="getting-started-guide">Getting Started Guide</h1>

<p><strong>nanoFramework</strong> enables the writing of managed code applications for embedded devices. Doesn't matter if you are a seasoned .NET developer or if you've just arrived here and want to give it a try.</p>
<p>This getting started guide will walk you through the setup of your development machine to get you coding a nice &quot;Hello World&quot; in no time!</p>
<p>You can find the video for this guide on our YouTube channel <a href="https://youtu.be/iZdN2GmefXI">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-hardware">The hardware</h2>
<p>In this guide we'll be using a ST Microelectronics <a href="http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/evaluation-tools/product-evaluation-tools/mcu-eval-tools/stm32-mcu-eval-tools/stm32-mcu-nucleo/nucleo-f746zg.html">STM32F746 NUCLEO</a> board. This is a rather common and inexpensive board that packs a Cortex M7 with 1MB flash, 320 kB of RAM and includes an ethernet connector.</p>
<h2 id="installing-visual-studio-2017">Installing Visual Studio 2017</h2>
<p>The first part is to get Visual Studio 2017 and the <strong>nanoFramework</strong> extension installed.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Download Visual Studio 2017. If you already have it installed, you can skip this step. If you don't, please download the free <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads">Visual Studio Community 2017</a> edition. Either way, make sure you've selected the .NET desktop workload.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Launch Visual Studio 2017 (we'll just refer to it as VS from now on) and install the <strong>nanoFramework</strong> extension. You can do this by going into Tools &gt; Extensions and Updates. Make sure you've switched the left-hand tree view to the Online branch and enter <em>nanoFramework</em> in the search box.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now open the Device Explorer window. You can do this by going into View &gt; Other Windows &gt; Device Explorer.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="uploading-the-firmware-to-the-board-using-the-st-link-utility">Uploading the firmware to the board Using the ST-LINK Utility</h2>
<p>The second part is to load the <strong>nanoFramework</strong> image in the board flash. Actually there are two images, one for nanoBooter and another one for nanoCLR. There are two methods to flash the image to the device. This method uses the ST-LINK Utility. The second method using a <strong>.dfu</strong> file will explored in the next section below.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Download the <a href="http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/development-tools/software-development-tools/stm32-software-development-tools/stm32-programmers/stsw-link004.html">STM32 ST-LINK Utility</a> from ST web site and install it in your development machine.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Download a ZIP file with the firmware for the board from our web site <a href="https://github.com/nanoframework/nf-interpreter#firmware-for-reference-boards">here</a> by clicking on the appropriate badge. This will take you to our JFrog Bintray repository that holds the packages with pre-build images for several target boards. After downloading it, unzip the package contents.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Connect the STM32F746 NUCLEO board to your PC using an USB cable. In fact, you'll be needing two USB cables with a micro USB connector. One to connect to the ST-Link debugger, that doubles as power supply to the board. And a second one to connect the USB client of the board.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Launch the ST-LINK Utility that you've just installed and connect to the STM32F746 NUCLEO board.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Perform a &quot;full chip erase&quot; to clear the flash.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Load the <code>nanoBooter.hex</code> file from the package and hit the &quot;Program and verify&quot; button. Make sure you tick the &quot;Reset after programming&quot; check box and hit &quot;Start&quot;. After the upload completes, the MCU is reset and the nanoBooter image runs. You can check the success of the operation watching for a slow blink pattern on the LED. Congratulations, you now have a board running nanoFramework's booter!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Next, load the <code>nanoCLR.hex</code> file from the extracted package folder and hit again the &quot;Program and verify&quot; button. Make sure you tick the &quot;Reset after programming&quot; check box and hit &quot;Start&quot;. After the upload completes, the MCU is reset and the nanoCLR image will run. This time and if all goes as expected, there will be no LED blinking. You can check if the board is properly running <strong>nanoFramework</strong> by looking into the Device Explorer window in VS.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="uploading-the-firmware-to-the-board-using-the-dfu-file">Uploading the firmware to the board using the <strong>.dfu file</strong></h2>
<p>This is the second method that can be used to flash the board.
To manually flash firmware using ST DFUSE tools, get a copy of <a href="https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-stm32080.html">ST DFUSE tools</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Install the DFUSE tools.</li>
<li>Put your device in bootloader mode. This can be accomplished by pressing a certain combination of buttons. It depends on the particular hardware that you are using.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="step-one">Step one</h3>
<ul>
<li>Start the STDFU Tester application.</li>
<li>Select the &quot;Protocol&quot; tab.</li>
<li>Press the &quot;Create from Map&quot; button.</li>
<li>Select the &quot;Erase&quot; radio button option.</li>
<li>Press the &quot;Go&quot; button.</li>
<li>Wait for the erase process to complete.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-two">Step two</h3>
<ul>
<li>Start the DFUSE Demo Application</li>
<li>Locate the <strong>.dfu file</strong> located in the device firmware update .zip file.
<blockquote>
<p>Note: If the .dfu file does not exist in the .zip file. It can be created following the instructions <a href="../stm32/create-dfu-file.html">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Click the &quot;Choose&quot; button then the &quot;Update&quot; button.</li>
<li>Toggle the devices power.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="coding-a-hello-world-application">Coding a 'Hello World' application</h2>
<p>Now you have everything that you need to start coding your first application. Let's go for a good old 'Hello World' in micro-controller mode, which is blinking a LED, shall we?</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Go back to VS and click File &gt; New &gt; Project. Make sure you have selected 'Framework 4.6 or above' and choose nanoFramework, on the left hand side tree view. Choose the 'Blank Application' template and a location of your choosing were the project files will be saved. Name your project and hit OK. The program file will be automatically opened for you.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We'll code a very simple application that enters an infinite loop and turns on and off an LED. We'll skip the details because that's not the aim of this guide. Let's just grab the code from the <strong>nanoFramework</strong> samples repo <a href="https://github.com/nanoframework/Samples/tree/master/Blinky">here</a>. Make sure that the correct GPIO pin is being used. That's the line below the comment mentioning the STM32F746 NUCLEO board.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Because GPIO is being used we need to pull that class library and a reference to it in our project. The class libraries are distributed through NuGet. To add this class, right click on 'References' in the Solution Explorer and click 'Manage NuGet Packages'. On the search box type 'nanoFramework'. Make sure you have the preview checkbox ticked. Find the Windows.Devices.Gpio package and click &quot;Install&quot;. After the license confirmation box, the package will be downloaded and a reference to it will be added. You'll notice that you no longer have the unknown references hints in VS.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Click &quot;Build Solution&quot; from the Build menu. A success message shows in the Build window.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We are almost there. Go into the Device Explorer window and click on the <strong>nanoFramework</strong> device showing there. Make sure the connection is OK by hitting the &quot;Ping&quot; button. On success, a message shows on the output window.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Let's deploy the application to the board. In order to do that, right click on the Project name and choose &quot;Deploy&quot;. You'll see the feedback of the several operations that are running on the background in the Output Window. After a successful deployment you need to reset the target and your 'Hello World' blinky application will start running and, <em>voilá</em>, the LED starts blinking! If you want, instead of &quot;just&quot; deploying the application to the target you can choose to start a debug session. To do that hit F5 (as usual) in Visual Studio and watch it run.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>
<p>Congratulations! That's your first <strong>nanoFramework</strong> C# application executing right there on the target board. How awesome is that?!</p>
<p>And this is it for the getting started guide.</p>
<p>You've went through the steps required to install Visual Studio, the <strong>nanoFramework</strong> extension and the ST-LINK Utility.</p>
<p>You've also learned how to upload <strong>nanoFramework</strong> firmware images into a target board.
And last, but not the least: how to code a simple 'Hello World' C# application and deploy it to a target board.</p>
